Using my Spotify data to create a series of interactive plots showing when I listen, who I listen to, and for how long. The primary library used for plotting was plot.ly, a free library that allows you to create interactive visualizations with relative ease. 

For viewing the plots and interacting with them, please refer to the write up of findings here: https://medium.com/@jordanbean/a-visual-look-at-my-taste-in-music-a8c197a728be
